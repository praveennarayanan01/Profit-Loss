# Profit-Loss
 Have to create a class where that class act as design pattern, that design pattern will create a object for a class and return through a method in java.

 lets assume, there is a class called "Product" in that class there are two private data memebrs called "productName" and "productValue" and we initialize those data members thorugh constructor. but here is the cache we have calculate three activity based on the data members. one is "profit and loss calculation" , second one is "purchase" fucntion and last one is "commision". but we can add specific input those methods in order to find those calculations. that's all about "Product" class. now we have to create Factory design pattern to Product class. in that Factory design pattern class we have to return object of Product class in order to initialize those data members. Now third class, means "Main" class we have to create object for Faactory design class to give input thorugh Product class by using Factory design class reference. give me this code in java.
